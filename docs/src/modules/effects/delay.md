# Stereo Delay

**Module ID** `fx.delay` · **Category** Effect

![Stereo Delay module](../../images/module-delay.png)
*Ping-pong, Sync and Tape switch the character; the knobs set the echoes*

The Stereo Delay plays back a copy of its input a moment later, then feeds that copy back in to make repeats. Filters in the feedback path darken or thin each repeat, **P-P** bounces the repeats between left and right, and **Sync** locks the time to the patch tempo.

Switch on **Tape** and it becomes a worn tape echo: the repeats waver in pitch, saturate as they build, and get darker each time around. Push the feedback far enough and they run away into the classic dub swell.

## How it works

1. Each channel is written into its own delay line.
2. A read head plays the line back **Time** later. Reads usually fall between two samples, and a cubic (Catmull-Rom) interpolator fills the gap, so time changes and modulation glide smoothly instead of clicking or dulling the highs.
3. The playback runs through **HiCut** and **LoCut**, is scaled by **FB**, and goes back into the line with the input. Each repeat passes through the filters once more than the one before it.
4. **Mix** blends the dry input with the playback.

## Inputs

| Port | Signal Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **In L** | Audio (Blue) | Left input |
| **In R** | Audio (Blue) | Right input. When unpatched, it copies In L |
| **Time CV** | Control (Orange) | Stretches or shrinks the delay time around the knob: ±1 swings it by ±50% |
| **Feedback CV** | Control (Orange) | Adds to the feedback around the knob: ±1 adds ±50% |

## Outputs

| Port | Signal Type | Description |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| **Out L** | Audio (Blue) | Left echoes, mixed with the dry signal |
| **Out R** | Audio (Blue) | Right echoes, mixed with the dry signal |

## Parameters

| Control | Range | Default | Description |
|---------|-------|---------|-------------|
| **Time** | 1 ms – 2000 ms | 500 ms | Time between echoes. Ignored while Sync is on |
| **FB** (Feedback) | 0 – 100% | 50% | How much of each repeat comes back |
| **Mix** | 0 – 100% | 50% | Dry (0%) to echoes only (100%) |
| **HiCut** | 100 Hz – 20 kHz | 10 kHz | Lowpass in the feedback path: darkens each repeat |
| **LoCut** | 20 Hz – 2 kHz | 20 Hz | Highpass in the feedback path: thins each repeat |
| **P-P** (Ping-Pong) | On / Off | Off | Each repeat crosses to the other channel |
| **Sync** | Off, 1/4, 1/8, 1/8T, 1/16, 1/16T, 1/32, 1/4D, 1/8D | Off | Locks the time to a note length at the patch tempo |
| **Tape** | On / Off | Off | Tape echo character (see [Tape mode](#tape-mode)) |

Time and FB keep working while their CV inputs are patched: the knob sets the center and the CV moves around it.

## Feedback

In normal mode, feedback stops at 95%, and a soft clipper in the loop keeps the echoes from growing out of control. Around 30% gives a few echoes that fade naturally; 60% gives long trails; the top of the knob repeats almost forever.

In Tape mode the knob reaches further. See [Runaway](#runaway).

## Tempo sync

Set **Sync** to a note length and the delay time follows the patch tempo. A [Clock](../modulation/clock.md) anywhere in the patch sets that tempo, so turning the Clock's **BPM** knob moves the echoes with it; they glide to the new time with a brief bend in pitch. With no Clock in the patch, the delay assumes 120 BPM. If a patch has more than one Clock, only one of them sets the tempo, so keep one Clock as the master.

| Division | Beats | At 120 BPM |
|----------|-------|------------|
| 1/4D | 1½ | 750 ms |
| 1/4 | 1 | 500 ms |
| 1/8D | ¾ | 375 ms |
| 1/8 | ½ | 250 ms |
| 1/8T | ⅓ | 167 ms |
| 1/16 | ¼ | 125 ms |
| 1/16T | ⅙ | 83 ms |
| 1/32 | ⅛ | 62.5 ms |

Synced times are capped at 2 seconds. **Time CV** still works while synced, swinging the synced time.

## Tape mode

**Tape** models a tape echo: a loop of tape passing a record head and a play head. Switching it crossfades in about 15 ms, so you can flip it while echoes are still sounding.

**Wow and flutter.** The play head wanders. A slow wow (about 0.5 Hz, plus a slower drift of the reel) and a fast flutter (6 to 10 Hz) bend the pitch of the repeats by a few cents. The four motions run at unrelated rates, so the pattern doesn't loop.

**Record-head saturation.** The input and the feedback are recorded together through a soft, slightly lopsided curve. Quiet signals pass unchanged; loud ones round off and pick up the even harmonics of magnetized tape. Because the saturation sits inside the loop, a busy echo squashes and thickens as it builds.

**Tape loss.** Tape loses top end every time it records, so each repeat is darker than the last. Longer delays mean slower tape and darker repeats: the loss starts around 7 kHz at 250 ms and falls to about 3.5 kHz at one second. **HiCut** still works on top of it.

**Motor glide.** Time changes glide over about a quarter of a second, like a motor finding its new speed, and the repeats swoop in pitch as they go.

### Runaway

In Tape mode, **FB** above about 90% pushes the loop past unity gain. The echoes grow until the record head's saturation holds them: the dub runaway. The output stays bounded at any setting, so you can ride it. Pull FB back below 90% and the echoes die away again.

## Bypass

Click the power switch in the node header, press **Ctrl+B** with the module selected, or choose **Bypass** from its right-click menu. In L passes straight to Out L and In R to Out R (In R still copies In L when unpatched). The switch crossfades over 20 ms. A bypassed delay stops running, and it starts from silence when you switch it back in, so old echoes don't come back with it.

## Patch ideas

**Slapback.** Time 80–120 ms, FB 0%, Mix 30%, Tape on. A single, slightly smeared echo, like a 1950s vocal.

**Dotted-eighth rhythm.** Sync 1/8D, FB 40%, Mix 40%. Turn on P-P with a stereo source and the repeats fall between the beats, alternating sides.

**Dub throw.** Sync 1/4 or 1/8D, FB 60%, LoCut 150 Hz, Tape on. For a bar, push FB up to the top and let it run away, then pull it back.

**Chorus from a delay.** A short time with the read head moving bends the copy's pitch:

```text
[LFO Out] ──> [Delay Time CV]      Time 15–30 ms, FB 0–20%, Mix 50%
```

**Ducking feedback.** An inverted envelope pulls the feedback down on every hit, so the echoes swell back between them:

```text
[Clock Gate] ──> [ADSR Gate]
[ADSR Out] ──> [Attenuverter In]   (negative Amount)
[Attenuverter Out] ──> [Delay Feedback CV]
```
