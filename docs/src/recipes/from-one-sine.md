# From One Sine

A whole song in one patch: four and a half minutes of D minor at 112 BPM, from a first note to a last one, with nobody at the keys. It opens the way every patch in this manual opens, on one sine wave playing a short tune, and part by part the rest of the rack joins in: a pad, an arpeggio, a bass, drums, bells, a supersaw lead. In the breakdown a [Looper](../modules/utilities/looper.md) plays the opening back to itself, reversed and an octave down. The song ends where it began, on the sine alone.

Nothing outside the patch tells it what to do. Two [Arrangers](../modules/utilities/arranger.md) are the score: they count the song in bars, through 24 named sections, and each of their lanes rides one part's fader, picks the drum pattern, strikes the crash or presses a pedal. Eighty modules play their part, of 28 kinds. Left running, it plays the song again from the top.

*The whole song, filmed in the app as it plays. The camera follows the score: it opens close on the lone sine, visits each part as it enters, pulls back to the whole rack for the drop, and ends where it began. [Watch on YouTube](https://youtu.be/xvmurP7NABw).*

Each section of the song is sixteen bars. On the Arrangers they're 24 sections: a new one wherever a part enters or leaves, and a one-bar **Fill** to close each phrase of the groove.

| Bars | Section | What happens |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 1–16 | First Sound | The sine plays the motif alone, with echoes and a hall, over a breath of wind. The pad, then sparkles, then a soft arpeggio fade in around it. The Looper records bars 5–8. |
| 17–32 | Pulse | The sine rests. The arpeggio steps forward, then the bass and the bells come in, over a heartbeat of kick, rim and offbeat hats. A small riser leads out. |
| 33–48 | Groove | A crash, and the full beat. The pad ducks under the kick. A fill closes the section. |
| 49–64 | Lift | The motif comes back on a seven-voice supersaw. The pad and bass grow brighter. |
| 65–80 | Memory | The drums, bass and lead drop out. The Looper's take of bars 5–8 plays reversed at half speed under the open pad and sparkles. The sine answers its own ghost. Then a four-bar build with a riser. |
| 81–96 | Everything | Drums, bass, arpeggio, pad, bells, sparkles and the lead at once, at the brightest the score sets. |
| 97–112 | Second wave | The lead rests and the sine sings over the groove instead, with the ghost underneath. The lead returns for the last eight bars. |
| 113–128 | Return | Parts leave one at a time until the sine is alone again. |

## What it teaches

- **A patch can hold its own arrangement.** An [Arranger](../modules/utilities/arranger.md) is a timeline of named sections, and its lanes are faders that move on cue. Each section jumps, ramps, holds or hits each lane as it starts.
- **Smoothing a control voltage.** A lane's **Glide** turns a jump into a glide, so a fader can move under a ringing note without a click: a second for the sustained parts, 40 ms for the rhythmic ones.
- **One lane, two jobs.** A lane's **Gate** is high while the lane is above zero, so the riser's lane sets its level and opens its envelope for exactly its section.
- **Harmony from mono parts.** A sequencer for each pad voice, stepping once a bar, sings real chords with real voice-leading. A root sequencer transposes the arpeggio and bass through **Exp FM**.
- **Hits press buttons.** A Hit is a trigger with a level on it: the crash and its accent, and the Looper's **Rec** and **Clear**.
- **Sidechain ducking.** The [Compressor](../modules/effects/compressor.md) on the pad listens to the kick.
- **Send and return.** Four [Mixers](../modules/utilities/mixer.md) chain their mixes and their sends along one cable each, so one delay and two reverbs serve the whole song.

## How it's built

### The score

```text
[Clock Gate] ──> [Desk Clock]
             ──> [Cues Clock]
[Desk Lane 6] ──> [Mixer Body Level 2]        (the pad, both sides)
              ──> [Mixer Body Level 3]
[Cues Lane 3] ──> [Mixer Sky Level 4]         (the riser's level)
[Cues Gate 3] ──> [Riser ADSR Gate]           (and its envelope)
```

Both Arrangers count the Clock's sixteenths, sixteen to a bar, through the same 24 sections: First Sound, Echo, Sparkles, Arp, Pulse, Bass, Bells, Riser, Groove, Fill, Lift, Fill, Memory, Answer, Build, Everything, Fill, Second Wave, Lead Returns, Fill, Return, Sine Returns, Thinning and One Sine. They change section on the same clock edge as the sequencers step on, so the score and the music can't drift apart. **Loop to** is 1, so the song goes round again.

**Desk**, the Arranger on the right, has a lane for each fader: the sine, arpeggio, bells, sparkles, bass, pad, wind and lead. On the Echoes, Body and Sky mixers each channel's **Level** knob is at zero, and its **Level** input adds the lane on top. Most sections jump a fader to a new level on their downbeat, and the rest hold it. The mixer adds a control voltage without smoothing it, so each lane has a **Glide**: a second for the pad, wind and sparkles, 0.8 s for the sine, 0.3 s for the lead, and 40 ms for the arp, bass and bells, which still land on the downbeat but never cut a tail short.

**Cues**, on the left, has the rest. **Drums** picks the drum pattern (see [Drums and fills](#drums-and-fills)). **Crash** hits on the downbeat of each big section, and its level is the cymbal's accent. **Riser** jumps to 30% for the Riser section and 32% for the Build. Its CV is the riser's level, and its gate holds the riser's envelope open for exactly those four bars. **Heat** ramps up through the opening, 8% to 48% over seven sections, and keeps climbing to its peak at Everything. Through two Attenuverters it opens the pad's Ladder and drives the bass harder. **Memory** is the Looper's level, and **Rec** and **Clear** hit its pedals.

### Harmony, a chord a bar

```text
[Clock Divider ÷16 Trig] ──> [Roots Clock], [Pad Voice 1–3 Clock]
[Roots Pitch] ──> [Pad Root Oscillator V/Oct]
              ──> [Arp Oscillator Exp FM]
              ──> [Bass Oscillator Exp FM]
[Pad Voice n Pitch] ──> [Pad Oscillator n V/Oct]
```

Sixteen bars of chords: Dm9, Bbmaj7, Fmaj7 and Cadd9 twice, then Gm7, Bb, Dm, C, Gm7, Bbmaj7, Csus4 and C. Four sequencers each take a step a bar. **Roots** plays the low voice, an octave down. The other three are the upper voices, and each one sings its own line through the changes, so the chords move by step instead of jumping in parallel. The four saws meet in a [Mix](../modules/utilities/mix.md), pass through one Ladder Filter, and duck under the kick in the Compressor. The Chorus spreads them into stereo.

The arpeggio and the bass are written over C, and **Roots** moves them to each chord through **Exp FM** at 1 octave per volt, as in [Afterglow](./afterglow.md). That only stays in key if the shapes have no third, so the arpeggio is made of roots, ninths and fifths, and the bass of roots, fifths and octaves. Over these roots, every note they play is in D minor.

### The motif and its memory

```text
[Clock Divider ÷4 Trig] ──> [Motif Clock]
[Motif Pitch] ──> [Sine V/Oct], [Supersaw V/Oct]
[Sine VCA Out] ──> [Mixer Echoes Ch 1]
               ──> [Looper In L]
[Cues Gate 6] ──> [Looper Rec]
[Clock Divider ÷16 Trig] ──> [Looper Clock]
[Looper Loop L/R] ──> [Mixer Sky Ch 2/3]
```

The motif is four bars of quarter notes, A, D E | F, D | C, A C | G, with ties for the long notes. It leans on notes that both halves of the progression share. A over Dm is the fifth and over Gm the ninth. C over F is the fifth and over Dm the seventh. So it fits whichever chords it lands on.

The Looper listens to the sine. At bar 5, the Echo section hits **Rec**. With bar pulses on its **Clock** and **Bars** at 4, the take starts on the downbeat and closes itself after four bars. The Looper is set to **½×** and **Rev** from the start. Neither changes what it records, only how it plays it back, so the loop plays reversed, an octave down, at half speed: eight bars, landing on the progression's own eight-bar grid. Its level stays at zero until the breakdown. First Sound hits **Clear** at bar 1, so each time the song comes round the Looper records the opening afresh.

### Drums and fills

```text
[Cues Lane 1] ──> [Drum Trigger Sequencer Pattern]
[Cues Gate 2] ──> [Cymbal Trig]
[Cues Lane 2] ──> [Cymbal Accent]
```

The drum sequencer's **Pattern** input picks a pattern for each new bar in quarters: 0 to 0.25 is A, then B, C and D. A is silence, B is a pulse of kick, rim and offbeat hats, C is the groove, and D is a build: four-on-the-floor kicks, toms, and a snare roll whose ratchets climb to four hits a step.

The **Drums** lane jumps to 0.10 for A, 0.35 for B, 0.52 for C and 0.85 for D. Each phrase of the groove ends on a one-bar **Fill** section, which jumps it to D for that bar, and the section after jumps it back. The sequencer reads its **Pattern** on the same sample the lane jumps, so the lane has no Glide.

The closed hat's gate chokes the open hat. The kick is tuned to A1, the fifth of D, and the tom to A2, so the drums sit in the key.

### The desk

```text
[Mixer Kit 2 Chain Out] ──> [Mixer Kit Chain In]
[Mixer Kit Chain Out] ──> [Mixer Body Chain In]
[Mixer Body Chain Out] ──> [Mixer Sky Chain In]
[Mixer Sky Out L/R] ──> [Audio Output Left/Right]
[Mixer Sky Send L/R] ──> [Plate Reverb In L/R] ──> [Mixer Sky Return L/R]
[Mixer Echoes Send L/R] ──> [Stereo Delay] ──> [Mixer Echoes Return L/R]
[Mixer Echoes Out L/R] ──> [Hall Reverb] ──> [Mixer Body Return L/R]
```

The sine, arpeggio, bells and sparkles share the Echoes mixer, whose send feeds a ping-pong tape delay on dotted eighths. Its output passes through a big hall and comes back on Body's **Return**. Body carries the bass, the pad in stereo and the wind. Sky carries the lead, the Looper's two sides and the riser. The two kit mixers chain into Body, and Body into Sky. Each chain cable carries a mixer's mix and its sends together, so the sends of all four ride along to Sky, where one plate reverb serves them. Echoes keeps its send for the delay.

## Variations

**Rearrange it.** Drag a lane on the Desk up or down in any section to move that fader, or right-click it to ramp instead of jump. Delete a **Fill** section on both Arrangers for a phrase of groove without a fill. Keep the two Arrangers' sections the same: they play one song.

**A shorter song.** Set both Arrangers' **Loop to** to 9, the Groove. The opening plays once, and then the song goes round from the groove to the end.

**Remember something else.** Patch the Arp's VCA into the Looper's **In L** instead of the sine. The breakdown then hears the arpeggio, slowed and backwards.

**Brighter all through.** Raise the **Offset** on the pad's brightness Attenuverter: each 0.1 opens the Ladder a tenth of an octave further, all song long.

**Straighter.** Set the Clock's **Swing** to 50%. Arp, bass and drums all straighten together, because they share its sixteenths.
