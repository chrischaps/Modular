"""Speaks the Vocoder example's line with a small formant synthesizer.

    python tools/voice/speak.py patches/samples/soba-speaks.wav

"Hello. I am Soba. I sing in sines." The voice is made here, from nothing
but a glottal pulse and noise, so the example ships no one's recording. It's
a Klatt-style cascade synthesizer (Klatt, "Software for a cascade/parallel
formant synthesizer", JASA 1980): a pulse train at the speaking pitch,
shaped like the airflow through the vocal folds, runs through a chain of
resonators. The lowest three are the formants, gliding from sound to sound;
the rest are fixed, as in a real tract. Nasals add a pole and a zero;
aspiration ("h") is noise through the same tract; "s" and "z" are noise
band-passed high, alongside it, and a little edge and breath above the
formants keeps the voice from going dull.

Everything runs at twice the output rate and is decimated, so the pulses'
sharp edges don't alias. The phrase is deterministic: the same file every
run.
