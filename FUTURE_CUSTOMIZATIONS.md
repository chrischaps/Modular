# Future Customizations

This document tracks visual and functional customizations that would require forking or modifying `egui_node_graph2` to achieve the aesthetic shown in the concept image.

## Why Fork?

The `egui_node_graph2` library provides a solid foundation for node graph editing, but it has limited hooks for deep visual customization. The library draws nodes, ports, and wires internally, exposing only:

- `titlebar_color()` - header bar color
- `top_bar_ui()` / `bottom_ui()` - custom UI in node header/footer
- `data_type_color()` - port and wire colors

To achieve the concept image aesthetic, we would need access to the internal rendering code.

## Wire/Cable Rendering

**Current state**: Library draws bezier curves with solid colors (5px * zoom width).

**Desired state** (from concept image):
- [ ] Thick cables with subtle glow effect
- [ ] Shadow underneath cables for depth
- [ ] Slight catenary droop for natural appearance
- [ ] Smooth anti-aliasing

**Required changes**:
- Modify `draw_connection()` in `editor_ui.rs` to:
  - Draw shadow pass first (offset, darker, semi-transparent)
  - Draw outer glow (wider stroke, semi-transparent signal color)
  - Draw main cable (current implementation)
  - Optionally add inner highlight

## Output Port Label Alignment

**Current state**: Output port labels (e.g., "Out") are left-aligned in the node body, while the actual port connector is on the right edge.

**Desired state**:
- [ ] Output labels right-aligned, positioned closer to their port connectors

**Possible solutions**:
1. **Custom rendering in `bottom_ui()`** - Hide default labels, render manually with right alignment
2. **Fork egui_node_graph2** - Add an `output_ui` trait method for custom output rendering
3. **Contribute upstream** - Submit PR to add output label customization

**Priority**: Low (functional, just not visually ideal)

## Node Styling

**Current state**: Library draws rounded rectangles with configurable title bar color.

**Desired state** (from concept image):
- [ ] Metallic 3D port connectors (circular jacks with highlight/shadow)
- [ ] More prominent node shadows
- [ ] Rounded rectangle body with subtle gradient
- [ ] Thicker border on selection

**Required changes**:
- Modify node rendering in `editor_ui.rs`:
  - Custom port drawing with metallic appearance
  - Enhanced shadow rendering
  - Configurable body fill/stroke styles

---

## Custom Widgets

**Current state**: Library uses standard egui widgets (sliders, checkboxes).

**Desired state** (from concept image):
- [ ] Rotary knobs with 3D appearance
- [ ] Custom faders with value display
- [ ] Waveform display widgets
- [ ] VU meters / level indicators

**Notes**: This may be achievable WITHOUT forking by:
1. Using `InputParamKind::ConstantOnly` and drawing custom widgets in `bottom_ui()`
2. Creating standalone egui widgets that can be composed
3. See Issues #17 (Widget Library) and #18 (Waveform Display)

## Alternative: egui-snarl

The `egui-snarl` library is another node graph option that may offer more customization flexibility:
- User-controlled wire rendering callbacks
- More explicit styling options
- Worth evaluating if egui_node_graph2 limitations become blocking

---

## Implementation Priority

If we decide to fork `egui_node_graph2`:

1. **High Priority**: Wire rendering (most visually impactful)
2. **Medium Priority**: Node shadows and selection styling
3. **Lower Priority**: Metallic port connectors (subtle improvement)

The custom widgets (knobs, faders, waveforms) should be attempted first WITHOUT forking, as they may be achievable through the existing `bottom_ui()` hook or as standalone egui widgets.
