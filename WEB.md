# Modular in the browser

The same app, compiled to WebAssembly and drawn on a canvas, so a page can
hand a visitor a patch to play instead of a video of one. It's published
beside the manual at **docs.chaps.dev/modular/play/**, and every recipe page
embeds its patch.

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
cargo install --locked trunk
trunk serve                 # http://127.0.0.1:8080, rebuilt on save
trunk build --release       # into dist/
```

| Address | Opens |
|---|---|
| `play/` | The full app on First Sound, with the last session's settings and any autosave |
| `play/?patch=lush-pad` | An **embed**: just the canvas and a Play bar, for an iframe. Any example's file name works |
| `play/?open=lush-pad` | That example in the full app (the embed's **Open in Modular** link) |

An embed keeps nothing: it doesn't restore or autosave a session, so playing
with a recipe never leaves an autosave for the full app to offer back.

This page is the spike report for issue #90: what stood in the way, what
was done about each, and how steady the sound is.

## What changed for the web

One `wasm32` cfg gate keeps the desktop build exactly as it was; the
`WEB` constant in `src/app/mod.rs` hides what the browser can't do.

| Area | Blocker | Done |
|---|---|---|
| **Entry point** | `run_native`, command-line arguments | `main.rs` has a second `main` for wasm32: `eframe::WebRunner` on `index.html`'s canvas, reading `?patch=` / `?open=` |
| **Clocks** | `std::time::Instant` and `SystemTime` panic on wasm32 | `web-time` everywhere (on the desktop it *is* `std::time`) |
| **Audio** | cpal needs a host | cpal's `wasm-bindgen` feature: the WebAudio host. A browser without Web Audio shows "No sound in this browser" instead of cpal's panic |
| **Autoplay** | Browsers hold an `AudioContext` until a gesture, and Safari only releases it *inside* the gesture | `index.html` notes every context and resumes it from the first pointer or key event; the status bar says "Click to start sound" until then |
| **MIDI** | The scanner thread holds a non-`Send` Web MIDI handle; Web MIDI needs a permission prompt and Safari has none | No device list or scanner in the browser. The engine and its queues stay, so the computer keys still play Poly MIDI |
| **Threads** | The recorder's writer thread, the MIDI scanner | Recording is hidden (it writes to a folder); the scanner isn't started |
| **Files** | `rfd`'s dialogs are async on the web, and there's no file system | **Save** downloads the patch; **Open** uploads one (`app/web.rs`). Examples were already `include_str!`. Recent files and the recordings folder are hidden; **My Modules** can't save (it needs a folder) |
| **Theme** | eframe follows the browser's light/dark preference, and a light browser started the theme from egui's light style | `apply_theme` pins egui to Dark first |
| **Phones** | First Sound is played from computer keys | The Keyboard and Poly MIDI modules' pianos play when held with the mouse or a finger, sliding legato (on the desktop too) |

### cpal's WebAudio scheduling, and a fix in the page

cpal's WebAudio host renders on the page's main thread: two
`AudioBufferSourceNode`s take turns, and as one ends its `ended` event renders
the next buffer and schedules it to start where the other leaves off. If the
page is busy past that moment, the buffer is scheduled in the past, and cpal
never catches up: every later buffer is scheduled early too, starting over the
one still playing. A single hiccup becomes garbled sound for good.

`index.html` wraps `AudioBufferSourceNode.start`: when a buffer would start
in the past, the schedule moves on by however late it was (plus 10 ms), so a
hiccup is one short dropout and then clean sound, a little later. The same
wrapper counts what the measurements below report (`modularAudioStats()` in
the console).

## How steady is it

Measured with Playwright driving each browser headless, playing each patch
for 30 seconds: the first half untouched, the second half with the canvas
dragged back and forth so the whole graph repaints every frame. Lush Pad is
the heaviest example (8 voices of 5-voice unison saws, chorus and reverb),
played with three keys held.

A **late** buffer is a dropout. **Render** is the time the app takes to
make one buffer, on the page's thread.

| Browser | Buffer | Lush Pad | Generative Ambient | First Sound | Render (Lush Pad) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chrome 154 | 2048 | 0 late | 0 late | 0 late | 3.7 ms avg, 10 ms max of 43 ms |
| Edge 154 | 2048 | 0 late | 0 late | 0 late | 3.7 ms avg, 9 ms max |
| Firefox 155 | 2048 | **15 late** (one every few seconds, after the first 13 s) | 0 late | 0 late | 4.5 ms avg |
| Firefox 155 | **4096** | 0 late (and 0 in a 60 s run) | 0 late | 0 late | 8.7 ms avg, 14 ms max of 93 ms |
| WebKit 26.6 (Playwright, Windows) | n/a | no Web Audio in this build: the app runs and says so | | | |

So the sound isn't short of CPU: rendering takes a tenth of the buffer or
less. Firefox's drops came a millisecond or so late each time, the look of
its `ended` events arriving late rather than of the page being busy. The
web build therefore asks Firefox for 4096-frame buffers and leaves Chrome,
Edge and Safari at the default 2048 (`web_buffer` in
`engine/audio_engine.rs`).

The cost is latency. From a key to the sound is about two buffers plus the
browser's own output delay: around 100 ms in Chrome, 200 ms in Firefox.
That's fine for exploring a patch and loose for playing live.

**Not measured here:** Safari, and a real phone. Playwright's WebKit on
Windows has no Web Audio, and its phone emulation fakes the pixel ratio
(it drew the UI twice the size; a real 2× scale factor draws it correctly).
Both need a look on real hardware: an iPhone or iPad, and Safari on a Mac.

## The AudioWorklet route

cpal's other web host, `audioworklet`, renders in the browser's audio thread,
off the page's thread, so drawing could never delay the sound and buffers
could shrink to 128 frames. It needs wasm threads: a nightly toolchain with
`-Z build-std` and the `atomics` target feature, and a cross-origin isolated
page (`Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` and `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`
headers) for `SharedArrayBuffer`. The docs site is static hosting that can't
set headers, so it would need the `coi-serviceworker` workaround, and an
isolated page can only be embedded by pages that opt in too.

Not worth it while the WebAudio host plays cleanly everywhere tested. It's
the step to take if the browser build is ever for playing live.

## Next steps

- Check Safari and a phone on real hardware.
- Fit the patch to an embed's frame: in a narrow iframe, the right of a
  patch (often the output) is off screen until the visitor pans.
- Scrolling: over an embed, the wheel and a dragging finger move the patch,
  not the page.
- Recording in the browser: render to memory and download the WAV.
- Web MIDI, behind a "Connect MIDI" button (Chrome, Edge and Firefox).
