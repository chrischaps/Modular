//! Engine Channels
//!
//! Lock-free communication between the UI thread and audio engine thread.
//! Uses rtrb ring buffers for SPSC (single-producer, single-consumer) queues:
//!
//! - **messages** (UI -> audio): compiled plans, parameter changes, play/stop
//! - **retired plans** (audio -> UI): replaced plans, to be dropped off the
//!   audio thread
//! - **retired taps** (audio -> UI): recording taps the audio thread is done
//!   with, for the same reason
//! - **retired inputs** (audio -> UI): audio input feeds, likewise
//! - **retired samples** (audio -> UI): recordings modules have let go of,
//!   so a long file is never freed in the audio callback
//! - **snapshots** (audio -> UI): copies of Loopers' loops, made into room
//!   the UI set aside, coming back to be saved
//! - **events** (audio -> UI): metering, monitor values, status
//! - **scope frames** (audio -> UI): oscilloscope captures, by value
//!
//! The UI side owns the [`AudioGraph`]. Structural commands edit it there,
//! and [`UiHandle::flush`] ships the result to the audio thread as a
//! compiled [`GraphPlan`], so nothing on the audio side ever allocates.
