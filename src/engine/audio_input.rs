//! Live audio input: carries a microphone, guitar or line source from the
//! input device's callback to the output callback.
//!
//! The two callbacks run on their own clocks, in their own buffer sizes, and
//! sometimes at their own sample rates. The input side's [`InputSender`]
//! pushes every frame it gets, as stereo, into an `rtrb` ring, converting it
//! to the output's rate first if the input device runs at another one. The
//! output side's [`InputFeed`] is a small jitter buffer over that ring:
//!
//! - It waits until the ring holds a little more than the largest input
//!   buffer and the largest output buffer seen (the *target*) before it
//!   starts reading, so the reads ride out the callbacks' uneven timing.
//! - **Underrun:** when a read finds too little, the missing frames are
//!   silence, and the feed waits to refill to the target before reading
//!   again. Each underrun adds a little cushion to the target, so a device
//!   pair that keeps running dry settles at a latency that works.
//! - **Overflow:** when the ring holds well over the target (the input clock
//!   runs a little fast, or the output stalled), the oldest frames are
//!   dropped back down to it. Frames the ring had no room for are dropped
//!   on the input side.
//! - **Settling:** on separate clocks, the ring starts out holding at
//!   least the target, often up to a buffer more, depending on where the
//!   reads fell as it filled. The sender stamps each push, so before each
//!   callback the feed knows the *fill*: the level, plus the input built up
//!   since the last buffer arrived. Unlike the level, the fill doesn't jump
//!   with each buffer, so the margin it leaves just before the next buffer
//!   is due holds whatever the phase between the callbacks. Over a couple
//!   of seconds, the feed trims away the margin never needed beyond the
//!   cushion; when it dips toward empty instead (an input clock running a
//!   little slow, or timing rougher than before), it stretches back up to
//!   the cushion before it runs dry. Both go a frame at a time, a block
//!   playing 0.4% fast or slow so nothing clicks, or a trim goes all at
//!   once while the input is quiet. Clocks that drift apart are followed
//!   this way rather than running dry or ahead. After a long run without
//!   an underrun the cushion steps back down, so one glitch at start-up
//!   doesn't cost latency for the rest of the session; if that runs dry
//!   again, it waits twice as long before the next try.
//!
//! All of these are counted, in frames, for the status bar.
//!
//! **Same clock.** When one driver serves both sides (ASIO), the input and
//! output callbacks run in lockstep, one after the other at each buffer
//! switch, at one rate. Their timing never wanders, so the feed holds just
//! one input buffer and no cushion: see [`input_channel_same_clock`]. If
//! the input callback runs first, each output reads the input that arrived
//! moments before it, and the buffer adds nothing to the round trip.
//!
//! The feed reaches the
//! audio thread inside an [`AudioMessage`] and goes back to the UI thread to
//! be dropped, like a recording's tap, so the ring is never freed there.
//!
