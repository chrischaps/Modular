//! Chord Sequencer module.
//!
//! Sixteen steps, each a chord: a root, a chord type and an optional slash
//! bass. Clocked like the Step Sequencer, it plays each chord as polyphonic
//! pitch, gate and velocity, one channel per chord tone, so a pad or an
//! electric piano made of polyphonic modules plays a progression on its own.
//!
//! The chord tones are placed by a voicing (close, open or spread) in the
//! octave Range names. With Voice Leading on, each chord takes the inversion
//! nearest the one before, so the voices move as little as they can, the way
//! a keyboard player's hands do.
