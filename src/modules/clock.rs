/// A clock module that generates periodic gate triggers.
///
/// Essential for testing envelope modules and creating rhythmic patterns
/// without external input.
///
/// # Ports
///
/// - **Sync** (Gate, Input): External clock sync input (resets the beat on
///   rising edge).
/// - **Gate** (Gate, Output): Periodic gate output (0.0 or 1.0).
/// - **Run** (Gate, Output): High while the clock runs.
/// - **Reset** (Gate, Output): A short pulse when the clock starts from the
///   top: Run switched on, or a MIDI Start.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - **Tempo** (20-300 BPM): Speed of the clock. Also sets the patch tempo
///   that tempo-synced modules, such as the Delay, follow.
/// - **Gate Length** (1-99%): Duration of the gate high as percentage of beat.
/// - **Division** (0-4): Note division (whole, half, quarter, eighth, sixteenth).
/// - **Run** (toggle): Whether the clock is running.
/// - **Source** (choice): Internal keeps its own time at Tempo; MIDI follows
///   the MIDI clock coming in (its ticks, Start, Continue and Stop).
/// - **Swing** (50-75%): Where the second pulse of each pair lands, as a
///   share of the pair. 50% is straight; 66% is a triplet shuffle. The first
///   pulse of each pair stays on the grid, so bars keep their length.
