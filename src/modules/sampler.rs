//! Sampler module.
//!
//! Plays a recording loaded from a WAV file: one-shots from a gate (drum
//! hits, vocal chops), or, with V/Oct and a polyphonic gate, an instrument
//! played across the keyboard, each channel of the cable its own voice.
//!
//! The recording arrives as an `Arc<SampleData>` through
//! [`DspModule::load_sample`], built off the audio thread. Voices read it
//! between samples on a Hermite curve, at a rate set tape-style by pitch
//! and Speed together, so a recording at another sample rate than the
//! engine's still plays in tune. Every start and stop is shaped by a short
//! envelope, so nothing clicks: a gate, a release, a voice stolen by a new
//! note, the end of the recording, even a new file loaded mid-note.

/// # Inputs
/// - **Gate** (Gate, poly): a rising edge starts a voice; in Gated mode the
///   falling edge releases it.
/// - **V/Oct** (Control): pitch, 1 V an octave; 0 V (C4) plays the Root note.
/// - **Velocity** (Control, 0–1): each note's level, read as it starts.
/// - **Start**, **Speed** (Control): added to their knobs.
///
/// # Outputs
/// - **L**, **R** (Audio, poly): a mono recording plays on both.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - **Start**, **End** (0–1 of the recording): what plays.
/// - **Loop** (Off / Forward / Ping-Pong), **Loop Start**, **Loop End**
///   (0–1 of the recording, kept inside Start–End).
/// - **Mode**: One-Shot plays on to the end whatever the gate does; Gated
///   releases when the gate falls.
/// - **Tune** (±24 st), **Fine** (±100 cents), **Root** (the note the
///   recording plays at unchanged).
/// - **Speed** (−2 to 2): tape speed, so pitch follows it; below 0 it plays
///   backwards, from End to Start.
/// - **Attack**, **Release** (s): the amplitude envelope.
/// - **Level** (0–1).
