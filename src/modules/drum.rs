//! Drum voice module.
//!
//! One analog-style voice that plays any of nine drums, the way an 808 or a
//! 909 makes each of its sounds from a few oscillators, a noise source,
//! filters and decays. Every type reads the same five knobs (Tune, Decay,
//! Tone, Snap, Level), each meaning what it would on that drum's own panel,
//! so a MIDI mapping keeps working when the Type changes.
//!
//! A hit is shaped by a [`Voicing`]: the envelopes and the pitch sweep, in
//! closed form. The voice follows it sample by sample, and the node display
//! draws it, so the picture is the sound.
