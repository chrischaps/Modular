//! Tape module: a tape machine for a bus.
//!
//! What a mix picks up on its way through a tape machine, after the
//! instruments: the record head's soft squash and the head bump, the wow and
//! flutter of the transport, the top end the tape can't hold, and, on an old
//! reel, dropouts and hiss.
//!
//! Each channel is recorded, then played back:
//!
//! 1. **Record.** Pre-emphasis (the speed's NAB, IEC or AES curve) lifts the
//!    treble, the drive pushes it into the Delay's record-head curve, and
//!    de-emphasis takes the treble back down, so the highs squash first, as
//!    they do on tape. Then the head bump of the speed, and the speed's top
//!    end. Saturation fades this in over the first tenth of its knob.
//! 2. **Transport.** A read head lagging the record head by the Delay's wow
//!    and flutter partials, as `A·(1 − cos)`: it never runs ahead, so the
//!    module adds no latency, and at no wobble it reads the record head
//!    exactly. The right track wobbles a little differently, by Width.
//! 3. **Playback.** Hiss, then the age of the tape: gap loss rolling off the
//!    top, and dropouts where the oxide has worn away.
//!
//! With every knob at zero each stage passes its input through bit for bit.
