//! Stereo Mixer module.
//!
//! Four channel strips, each with a level, a pan, a width, a send, a mute
//! and a solo, summed into a stereo pair under one master level. A
//! polyphonic cable into a channel can be fanned across the stereo field
//! with its Width, so a chord opens up instead of sitting dead centre.
//!
//! Each channel's Send feeds Send L/R after its fader and pan; the effect
//! comes back on Return L/R, which may close the loop through this same
//! mixer (it's then heard a block late).
//!
//! Mixers cascade, as console sidecars do, over one cable. Chain Out carries
//! the whole mix on a Bus cable, four strands: the stereo pair and the send
//! bus. Into the next Mixer's Chain In, the pair joins its mix after the
//! faders and the sends join its send bus, so a kit spread over several
//! mixers stays stereo and shares one reverb.
//!
//! For a plain mono sum, of CVs or of audio, there's the Mix module.

/// # Ports
///
/// **Inputs:**
/// - **Ch 1** to **Ch 4** (Audio): The channels. A polyphonic cable keeps
///   its voices apart, so Width can place them.
/// - **Level 1** to **Level 4** (Control): CV added to each channel's level.
/// - **Pan 1** to **Pan 4** (Control): CV added to each channel's pan.
/// - **Chain In** (Bus): Another Mixer's Chain Out. Its mix joins this one
///   after the faders, and its sends join this one's send bus.
/// - **Return L**, **Return R** (Audio, late): An effect's output, added at
///   the Return knob. A cable here may close a loop through this mixer.
///   R copies L when only L is patched, so a mono source comes in centred.
///
/// **Outputs:**
/// - **Out L**, **Out R** (Audio): The stereo mix.
/// - **Send L**, **Send R** (Audio): The send bus, for one effect to serve
///   every channel.
/// - **Chain Out** (Bus): Out L/R and Send L/R on one cable, for the next
///   Mixer's Chain In.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - **Level 1** to **Level 4** (0 to 1): Each channel's volume. Default 1.
/// - **Pan 1** to **Pan 4** (-1 to 1): Each channel's place, equal power.
/// - **Width 1** to **Width 4** (0 to 1): How far a polyphonic channel's
///   voices fan out around its pan. Default 0, where they all sit at it.
/// - **Send 1** to **Send 4** (0 to 1): How much of each channel, after its
///   fader and pan, goes to Send L/R. Default 0.
/// - **Mute 1** to **Mute 4**: Silences a channel.
/// - **Solo 1** to **Solo 4**: Hears only the soloed channels.
/// - **Return** (0 to 1): Level of Return L/R in the mix. Default 1.
/// - **Master** (-60 to +6 dB): Volume of the mix. Default 0 dB.
