//! Looper module.
//!
//! Works like a looper pedal. Play into it, tap Rec to start recording, tap
//! again to close the loop, and it plays back while you play over it. Keep
//! tapping to overdub layers, undo the last one, or stop and clear.
//!
//! # The tape
//!
//! The loop lives in two banks of stereo frames, allocated when the module
//! is prepared (two minutes each), and two bitsets over them. `base` says
//! which bank holds each frame as it was before the last overdub layer, and
//! `layer` which frames that layer wrote, into the other bank. Undo hides
//! the layer and redo shows it again, so both are a flag, however long the
//! loop. Starting the next layer folds the visible one into `base`, a pass
//! over the bits rather than the audio.
//!
//! # Timing
//!
//! A loop's frames are counted from the moment the take began. Live input
//! reaches the patch a round trip after the player played it, along with
//! what they heard, so every write lands that many frames back
//! ([`ProcessContext::input_latency`], plus the Offset knob).
//!
//! The playhead counts half frames, so Speed ×½, ×1 and ×2, backwards or
//! forwards, all land exactly on the grid. Overdubbing at another speed
//! writes at that speed too: an overdub at ×½ plays back an octave up at ×1.
//!
//! # Seams
//!
//! A take keeps recording for a few milliseconds past where it closed, and
//! that pre-roll is crossfaded over the loop's first frames, so the wrap
//! goes on into what was really played next. Every overdub punches in and
//! out over the same few milliseconds, and stopping, clearing and undoing
//! fade rather than cut.

/// - **Stop** (Gate): stops playback; again restarts the loop from the top.
/// - **Undo** (Gate): takes back the last overdub layer, or brings it back.
/// - **Clear** (Gate): empties the loop.
/// - **Clock** (Gate): when patched, recording starts on a pulse and its
///   loop closes on a whole bar.
///
/// # Outputs
/// - **Out L**, **Out R** (Audio): the input and the loop.
/// - **Loop L**, **Loop R** (Audio): the loop alone.

///
/// # Parameters
/// - **Speed** (½×, 1×, 2×) and **Reverse**: how it plays, not what's kept.
/// - **Bars** (Free, 1–16): with a Clock, how many bars a take lasts.
/// - **Latency** (Off / Auto): take the round trip measured for live input
///   off overdubs fed by an Audio Input.
/// - **Feedback** (0–1): how much of the loop each overdub pass keeps.
/// - **Loop Level**, **Dry Level** (0–1).
/// - **Offset** (±50 ms): moves overdubs earlier (+) or later (−), on top
///   of Latency.
/// - **Pedal Rec**, **Pedal Stop**, **Pedal Undo**, **Pedal Clear**: the
///   footswitches on the node, which a MIDI controller can press too.
