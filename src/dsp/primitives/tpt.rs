//! Topology-preserving transform (TPT) building blocks.
//!
//! The TPT approach (Zavalishin, *The Art of VA Filter Design*) discretises
//! an analog block diagram by swapping each integrator for a trapezoidal one
//! and solving the resulting zero-delay feedback loops directly. Filters built
//! this way keep the analog response, stay stable under fast modulation, and
//! can carry nonlinearities in the same places the circuit has them.
